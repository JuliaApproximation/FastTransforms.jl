# # Calculus on the reference triangle
# In this example, we sample a bivariate function:
# ```math
# f(x,y) = \frac{1}{1+x^2+y^2},
# ```
# on the reference triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,0)$ and analyze it
# in a Proriol series. Then, we find Proriol series for each component of its
# gradient by term-by-term differentiation of our expansion, and we compare them
# with the true Proriol series by sampling an exact expression for the gradient.
#
# We analyze $f(x,y)$ on an $N\times M$ mapped tensor product grid defined by:
# ```math
# \begin{aligned}
# x & = (1+u)/2,\quad{\rm and}\quad y = (1-u)(1+v)/4,\quad {\rm where:}\\
# u_n & = \cos\left[(n+\tfrac{1}{2})\pi/N\right],\quad{\rm for}\quad 0\le n < N,\quad{\rm and}\\
# v_m & = \cos\left[(m+\tfrac{1}{2})\pi/M\right],\quad{\rm for}\quad 0\le m < M;
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# we convert the function samples to mapped Chebyshev² coefficients using
# `plan_tri_analysis`; and finally, we transform the mapped Chebyshev²
# coefficients to Proriol coefficients using `plan_tri2cheb`.
#

# Our function $f$ and the Cartesian components of its gradient:
f = (x,y) -> 1/(1+x^2+y^2)
fx = (x,y) -> -2x/(1+x^2+y^2)^2
fy = (x,y) -> -2y/(1+x^2+y^2)^2

# The polynomial degree:
N = 15
M = N

# The parameters of the Proriol series:
α, β, γ = 0, 0, 0

# The $u$ grid:
u = [sinpi((N-2n-1)/(2N)) for n in 0:N-1]

# And the $v$ grid:
v = [sinpi((M-2m-1)/(2M)) for m in 0:M-1]

# Instead of using the $u\times v$ grid, we use one with more accuracy near the origin.
# Defining $x$ by:
x = [sinpi((2N-2n-1)/(4N))^2 for n in 0:N-1]

# And $w$ by:
w = [sinpi((2M-2m-1)/(4M))^2 for m in 0:M-1]

# We see how the two grids are related:
((1 .+ u)./2 ≈ x) * ((1 .- u).*(1 .+ v')/4 ≈ reverse(x).*w')

# On the mapped tensor product grid, our function samples are:
F = [f(x[n+1], x[N-n]*w[m+1]) for n in 0:N-1, m in 0:M-1]

# We superpose a surface plot of $f$ on top of the grid:
X = [x for x in x, w in w]
Y = [x[N-n]*w[m+1] for n in 0:N-1, m in 0:M-1]
